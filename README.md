Clicker for Everyone - a multiplayer clicker built on Unity. Current status: legacy

Note on the source code: The code was initially created using vibe-coding by me when I was still unfamiliar with C#. I have since edited it to reduce the amount of vibe-coding.

There is also a web version available, which was created using TurboWarp, although the source code for that version is not available. https://github.com/scd5dev/ClickerForEveryoneOld

By the way, this game was supposed to be released on Google Play at some point, but due to my developer account being blocked for no reason, it didn't happen.
