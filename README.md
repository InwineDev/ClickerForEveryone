Clicker for Everyone - a multiplayer clicker built on Unity. Current status: legacy

Note on the source code: The code was initially created using vibe-coding by me when I was still unfamiliar with C#. I have since edited it to reduce the amount of vibe-coding.

There is also a web version available, which was created using TurboWarp, although the source code for that version is not available. https://github.com/scd5dev/ClickerForEveryoneOld
